/*
Arrays can hold only the homogeneous data elements, but we can resolve this issue by creating an object array.
Array concept is not implemented based on some standard data structures, so readymade method support is not available.
So to overcome the problems of array we use collections.

Arrays are fixed in size while collections are growable.
WRT to performance arrays are always invented.
WRT to memory Collections are always invented.
Arrays are not based on some standard data structures so readymade method support is not available while collections are opposite.
Primitives and objects we can hold in array while in collections we can hold only objects.
Collections framework are collection of Interface and Class.

There are 7 seven interfaces in collections and 3 interfaces in Maps*/
